## Internet Of Things Event Driven Archtitecture

Sample Node-Red flows.

The sample-core-app.json is a very very crude flow that shows how to use Node-Red to connect to an MQTT Message Broker and subscribed to data events.

The sample-edge-app.json is another very very crude flow that emulates an "edge" application that sends data events, via an MQTT Message Broker, up to the "cloud" and a Core application.

Please reach out to the instructor if you like to spend 30 mins on this and get it working.
