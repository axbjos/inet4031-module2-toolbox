# INET4031 - The System Administrator's Toolbox

Use the tools that administrators use.

Administrators who manage servers and cloud services must be skilled in the use of many different tools and technologies.  This includes a mix of command-line and GUI-based tools. The skilled System Administrator can easily complete tasks regardless of the environment.

Additionally, while System Administrators are not code developers, they should be able to understand code, write code, and use code editors.  For example a System Administrator supporting a data science team may not fully understand the math and tools used by the data scientists or the programs they code, but should have some basic familiarity.
