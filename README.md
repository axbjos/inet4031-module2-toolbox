# INET4031 - The System Administrator's Toolbox

Let's continue to do some more stuff like we did in Module 1 - continuing our introductory exploration of system administration.

Administrators who manage servers and cloud services must be skilled in the use of many different tools and technologies.  This includes a mix of command-line and GUI-based tools. The skilled System Administrator can easily complete tasks regardless of the environment.

Additionally, while System Administrators are not code developers, they should be able to understand code, write code, and use code editors.  For example a System Administrator supporting a data science team may not fully understand the math and tools used by the data scientists or the programs they code, but should have some basic familiarity.

In upcoming Modules we will begin work on the administration of servers. For right now though we are going to concetrate on the "system administration" you already know how to do.  You've no doubt had to install software on your laptop. Installing programs, installing programming languages, making configuration changes to connect your laptop to a WiFi network.  Although we may not think of this as "system administration" it IS system administration.  Adminstration of your local system.

In this module we are going to do the following:

* Install the Jupyter Notebook system like many Data Scientist use.
* Install the NodeJS package so that we can run JavaScript programs on our computers.
